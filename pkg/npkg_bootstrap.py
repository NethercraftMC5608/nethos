npkg_bootstrap — build a root filesystem from converted Debian packages.

Debian supplies the packages; the result is laid out and administered the Arch
way. That means:

    /usr/bin        everything executable, sbin merged in
    /usr/lib        every library, Debian's multiarch triplet flattened away
    /bin /sbin /lib /lib64 /usr/sbin   compatibility symlinks into /usr
    wheel           the administrators' group, as on Arch
    /home/<user>    a real home, from /etc/skel

    npkg-bootstrap /mnt/newroot --user caleb
    npkg-bootstrap /mnt/newroot --set desktop --arch arm64

Solving happens against Debian's own Packages index, because that is where
the dependency truth lives; only then are the .debs converted and installed.

Run as root for a bootable result: setuid bits on sudo and su survive the
tarball, but file ownership can only be applied by root, and a sudo owned by
you rather than root will refuse to run.
