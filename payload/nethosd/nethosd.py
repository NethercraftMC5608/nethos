nethosd - the NETHOS shell bridge and app host.

The NETHOS desktop is written in HTML/CSS/JS and runs inside Chromium. This
daemon is the only thing standing between that web shell and the real system:
it serves the shell, the app SDK and every installed NETHOS app, and exposes a
small JSON API over loopback for the things a web page cannot do on its own.

Performance notes, because they shaped the design:

  * sway is driven over a persistent IPC socket, not by spawning `swaymsg`.
    A subprocess per taskbar tick is brutal on a slow machine, and the shell
    ticks constantly.
  * window state is push-based. A background thread subscribes to sway's event
    stream and forwards changes to the shell over SSE, so nothing polls a
    multi-megabyte window tree on a timer.
  * the launcher is pre-warmed at session start and toggled with sway's
    scratchpad, so opening it is a compositor operation rather than a cold
    Chromium start.

Deliberate constraints: stdlib only, loopback only, and never execute an
arbitrary command string from a page.

NOT a security boundary: every local app shares one origin and one API, so app
"permissions" are scoping and hygiene, not a sandbox.
