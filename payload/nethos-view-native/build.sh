# Build nethos-view-native and drop the binary into payload/bin/, the same
# place install-nethos.sh's install_desktop() already copies every
# payload/bin/nethos-* binary from with a plain `install -m 0755` -- that
# loop is binary-agnostic, so it needs no change to pick this up.
#
# Second architecture for this rewrite: GTK4 + WebKitGTK + gtk4-layer-shell,
# the same engine payload/bin/nethos-view (Python) already runs, instead of
# Phase 1's raw Wayland/EGL/WPE. No more wayland-scanner protocol generation
# at all -- GTK and gtk4-layer-shell own every bit of compositor-client
# protocol work themselves now. See docs/NETHOS-VIEW-REWRITE.md and
# nethos_view.h's own header comment for why.
